{"message":"Okay, I'm ready to be your social media engagement advisor! Please provide the following information so I can give you the best advice:\n\n1. **The `text` of the post itself:**  Paste the exact text you intend to use.\n2. **The `post-type`:**  Tell me where you plan to post this (e.g., Instagram Reel, Facebook Post, X/Twitter thread, LinkedIn article, TikTok video, etc.).  Be specific!  \"Instagram\" isn't enough â€“ is it a Story, a Reel, a carousel post, or a regular post?\n3. **Target audience:** Briefly describe who you're trying to reach (e.g., \"Gen Z interested in sustainable fashion,\" \"B2B marketers in the SaaS industry,\" \"local dog owners\").\n\nOnce I have this information, I'll analyze your post's potential reach and suggest improvements. My analysis will consider factors like:\n\n* **Content relevance:** How well does the content match the platform and the target audience's interests?\n* **Format and length:** Is the post optimized for the chosen platform (e.g., short-form video for TikTok, longer text for LinkedIn)?\n* **Use of hashtags and keywords:** Are you using relevant and effective hashtags/keywords to increase discoverability?\n* **Engagement triggers:** Does the post encourage interaction (e.g., questions, calls to action, polls)?\n* **Visual appeal (if applicable):**  Are images/videos high-quality, engaging, and appropriately sized?\n\nI'll provide specific, actionable recommendations to help you boost your reach and engagement. Let's get started!\n"}
